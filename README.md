# Hi there 👋 I'm MrBrandao

## About Me

I'm a long life learner, who enjoys to have a deep understanding of how things work, specially when it's related to computers, eletronics and networks.
I also do like preserving and restoring digital art and old eletronic devices through open-source projects.
